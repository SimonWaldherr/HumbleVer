# HumbleVer
## A Versioning Model That Embraces Imperfection

**HumbleVer** is a self-aware versioning model designed for developers who recognize that software is never truly "done". It acknowledges the iterative nature of development, the reality of imperfection, and the humility required to improve.

## Philosophy: Progress, Not Perfection  
In a world filled with ambitious versioning models, HumbleVer stands apart by embracing the fact that software is a journey, not a destination. Inspired by introspection and self-awareness, **HumbleVer** always starts at `0.` and never reaches `1.0.0`. Why? Because perfection is unattainable, and that's okay.

## Versioning Format

HumbleVer uses the format:  

```
0.HOPE.ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
```

### Components:
1. **`0.`**  
   The eternal reminder that software is a work in progress. No matter how much it improves, it can always be better.  
   
2. **`HOPE`**  
   A cautiously optimistic number incremented when adding new features or making notable progress.  
   - Example: Adding a new functionality that you hope will work as intended.  

3. **`ACKNOWLEDGEMENT`**  
   A humbler number incremented for bug fixes, tweaks, or addressing things that could have been better.  
   - Example: Fixing the typo in the login button or patching that crash no one should have noticed.

### Examples:
- `0.1.0`: The first tentative release. "We think this might work."
- `0.2.3`: Incrementally better, with a few bugs squashed along the way.
- `0.7.12`: Steady progress; still not done, but getting closer.

## Why HumbleVer?  

- **Realistic**: Acknowledge that every release is imperfect, and that's okay.  
- **Transparent**: Reflect the real-world iterative nature of software development.  
- **Fun**: Add a touch of self-deprecating humor to an otherwise dry process.

## Comparison to Other Versioning Models  

### 1. **Semantic Versioning ([SemVer](https://github.com/semver/semver))**  
- Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`  
- Philosophy: Communicates API compatibility and stability with clear rules.  
- Key Difference: **SemVer assumes software can reach a "stable" `1.0.0`,** whereas HumbleVer humbly remains a perpetual work in progress.

### 2. **[PrideVer](https://pridever.org)**  
- Format: `PROUD.DEFAULT.SHAME`  
- Philosophy: Celebrate proud moments of brilliance, acknowledge average releases, and own up to embarrassing fixes.  
- Key Difference: **PrideVer is emotionally expressive, while HumbleVer leans into quiet introspection.**

### 3. **TeX Versioning**  
- Format: Incrementally closer to œÄ (e.g., `3.1`, `3.14`, `3.141`)  
- Philosophy: Reflects perfectionism by asymptotically approaching an ideal state.  
- Key Difference: **TeX strives for perfection, HumbleVer accepts imperfection as inevitable.**

2. **Mascot**  
   - HumbleVer‚Äôs mascot is a **turtle** üê¢‚Äîa humble, steady creature symbolizing slow but consistent progress.  

3. **"Shame Log"**  
   - Encourage teams to document embarrassing bugs fixed in each release.  
     - Example:  
       ```
       ## Version 0.4.7
       - Fixed typo in the title screen ("Startt" ‚Üí "Start").
       - Patched crash when clicking the save button multiple times.
       - Removed debug password accidentally left in production.
